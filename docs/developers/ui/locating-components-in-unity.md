## Overview

To maintain consistency and efficiency in the development of the Netherlands3D platform, a systematic approach is
adopted for organizing components within Unity and Figma. This documentation outlines the structure and location of
Unity Components in relation to their counterparts in Figma, facilitating easy navigation and management for developers
and designers alike.

## Unity Structure

### Prefabs and Scripts

Location: Within the Unity project, two primary folders, Prefabs and Scripts, house the components essential for
building the UI and functionality of the Netherlands3D platform.

UI/Components Subfolder: Both Prefabs and Scripts contain a subfolder named UI/Components. This subfolder is dedicated
to storing UI-related prefabs and scripts, mirroring the component organization seen in Figma.

### Component Grouping

Structure: The UI/Components folder in Unity is organized into subfolders that reflect the component grouping structure
found in Figma's Assets tab. This methodical arrangement ensures that for every component designed in Figma, there is a
corresponding prefab or script in Unity.
Examples: If Figma has groups such as Input Controls, Navigation, and Data Display, similar subfolders will be present
under Unity's UI/Components, ensuring a one-to-one mapping of design assets to development assets.

## Figma Structure

### Assets Tab

Component Grouping: Figma's Assets tab utilizes a structured approach to organize design components into groups,
facilitating easy access and reference for designers.
Naming Convention: Each component and group within Figma is named systematically, aligning with the naming used in
Unity's UI/Components folder structure to maintain consistency.

## Bridging Design and Development

### Synchronized Organization

Purpose: The mirrored folder structure between Unity and Figma aims to streamline the workflow, allowing designers and
developers to easily locate corresponding components across platforms.
Best Practices: Regular updates and reviews of the folder structures are recommended to ensure ongoing alignment as new
components are added or existing ones are modified.
Navigation and Usage
Finding Components: Developers and designers can quickly locate a specific component's prefab, script, or design asset
by navigating to the UI/Components folder in Unity or the corresponding group in Figma's Assets tab.
Consistency: This organizational strategy enhances collaboration, ensuring that both design and development teams are
working with the same component definitions and expectations.
