# Architectural Decisions

In the Netherlands3D project, we recognize the importance of documenting key architectural decisions to ensure that the
rationale behind our choices is clear, traceable, and accessible to all contributors and stakeholders. This section
serves as a living document where we track these decisions, both accepted and rejected, to provide a transparent record
of our technical direction.

## Why Track Architectural Decisions?

Architectural decisions often shape the foundation of a project and influence how future features are built. By
documenting these decisions:

* **We ensure clarity and alignment**: Everyone working on the project understands why certain paths were chosen over
  others.
* **We maintain consistency**: Having a record of decisions helps to maintain a coherent and stable architectural vision
  as the project evolves.
* **We enable future-proofing**: Teams and future developers can reference past decisions to avoid re-evaluating or
  re-implementing resolved issues.
* **We encourage informed collaboration**: It creates an open dialogue for discussing technical options and ensures
  everyone has access to the decision-making process.

## What to Expect

In this section, you will find a record of:

* **Accepted proposals**: Decisions that have been approved and are guiding the current development.
* **Rejected proposals**: Ideas that were considered but ultimately not adopted, along with the reasons why.
* **Ongoing discussions**: Some entries may reflect decisions that are still under consideration, providing insight into
  our ongoing thought process.

Each architectural decision is written in a lightweight, actionable format that includes a summary of the problem, the
considered options, the decision taken, and the rationale behind it. We strive to keep these entries concise while
capturing the essential technical and business context.

## Language Considerations

Since the core Netherlands3D team operates primarily in Dutch, many architectural proposals and discussions will
initially be documented in Dutch. This allows us to facilitate faster and more in-depth discussions within the team.
However, we strive to provide English translations for most of these decisions to ensure that non-Dutch speakers can
follow and contribute to the project. Whenever possible, both Dutch and English versions of each decision will be
available.
